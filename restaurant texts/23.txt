There are a few common phrases you could use to order food. Here are some examples:

I’ll have the fried chicken.

I would like the fried chicken.

I’d like to order the fried chicken.

Can I have the fried chicken?

In certain cases, it makes sense to use “we” instead of “I.” This is often the case if you’re ordering something for everyone, not just yourself.

We would like to share the mozzarella sticks.

We’ll start with an appetizer.

We’ll have a pitcher of beer.

Sometimes, your order will require the server to ask follow-up questions. Here are some common questions the server may ask and some possible responses.

Server: How would you like your steak/burger cooked?

You: Medium-well, please.

Server: Which two sides would you like with your meal?

You: I’ll have french fries and grilled vegetables.

Server: What dressing would you like with your salad?

You: Ranch, please.
