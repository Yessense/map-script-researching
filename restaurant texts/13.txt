Waiters in American restaurants are more pleasant and attentive. They are always chatty and often come to your table during the meal to refill drinks and check everything is okay. In England, waiters are less likely to frequently check on customers. If you need something, you can raise your hand and waive at the waiter or else, you will be left alone for hours.
