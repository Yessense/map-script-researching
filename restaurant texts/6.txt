Book a table on the phone or ask for a table by saying “We’d like a table for 5, please.” This will let the waiter know how many people to expect. The waiter might ask “How many people are in your party?” In this question ‘party’ means ‘group’ not ‘celebration’. If you’re in a country where people are allowed to smoke in restaurants, the waiter might ask if you’d like to sit in the smoking or non-smoking section. If you’re in a hot country, the waiter may ask if you’d prefer to sit indoors or outdoors. Make it clear exactly where you want to sit for a perfect meal.
