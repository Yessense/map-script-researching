Remember, the host is the person who greets you when you enter the restaurant. They’re usually standing at a podium, or you may see a sign that says, “Please wait to be seated.” This means that the host might be with another customer right now, but they’ll be back to greet you.

Maybe you called ahead of time to make a reservation, which means the restaurant knows you’re coming and has a table set aside for you. If that’s the case, the conversation will probably go something like this:

Host: Hi, welcome to [restaurant name].

You: Hello, I have a reservation.

Host: What’s your name?

You: John Smith.

Then, the host will say something like, “Right this way,” and you can follow them to your table. Or if they aren’t ready yet, they’ll say something along the lines of, “Your table will be ready in a few minutes.”

What if you don’t have a reservation? Then the conversation may look something like this:

Host: Hi, welcome to [restaurant name].

You: Hello, we’d like a table for two people.

Host: Would you like a table or a booth?

You: A booth.

Then the host will likely say either, “Right this way,” or if the restaurant is crowded, they may tell you,”It will be a 10-minute wait.”

When you ask for a table for two people, the host might ask you, “Do you have a reservation?” In this case, you’d respond, “No.”
