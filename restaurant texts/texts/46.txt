A meal at a really great restaurant is akin to a night at the theater: several hours of entertainment as a chef shows off what he or she can doâ€”with assistance from a supporting cast of servers, kitchen staff, and the guests themselves. So treat the experience accordingly, savoring the live show and giving it all the attention you would a high-priced play.
