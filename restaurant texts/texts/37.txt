Upon arriving to the restaurant and being shown your table by the maître d', it might seem deferential to allow your date or guest to walk ahead of you. But in this case, you have actually got things turned around.

"As the host, when following the maître d' to the table, you should always follow directly behind him or her first, allowing your guest to follow you," says Parker Geiger, CEO of personal branding company Chuva Beyond, who has worked with organizations such as ESPN and Amazon on the topic of fine dining. "This allows you to ensure that everyone sits where you would like them to sit as they approach the table."
