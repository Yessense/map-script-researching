But my absolute favourite is a fast food restaurant McDonald’s. I go there a few times a week.

Prices are very low, so everyone can afford coming here quite often. Food preparation does not take much time: usually about 5-10 minutes depending on the number of customers. The food itself is very filling; you definitely won't be hungry after it!

Everyone will find something in the menu. There is a wide range of dishes from vegetarian vegetable salad to chicken nuggets. In the mornings one can buy unique dishes, such as a burger with an egg and bacon or an omelette. My favourite set includes a cheeseburger, a chickenburger, medium french fries and a glass of orange juice. Sometimes I can indulge myself with some dessert, for example, ice cream or berry pie.

Service in the restaurant is also at a high level. Employees are polite and always ready to help, despite the fact that there is a huge crowd of customers in the hall. The music is just as great! Often my friends and I come to McDonald’s to have a good time and enjoy a delicious dinner!
