First of all, you should look tidy and rather elegant. If you go to a good restaurant, you are supposed to be well-dressed. Choose an evening dress if you are a woman or a presentable suit if you are a man. Don’t look brassily or tawdry.

Then you enter a restaurant and see a friendly waiter or waitress who leads you to your table and gives a menu. Look at it carefully before ordering, avoid dishes which may contain ingredients you don’t like or are allergic to. If you are not sure about some menu items, don’t hesitate to ask a waiter. He will gladly advise you what to order.

When your food is on the table, take a second to put a napkin on your knees in order not to get dirty and look silly afterwards. You should also respect food traditions and rules if you eat in a restaurant with a foreign cuisine.

If you are in an Asian restaurant, try to use chopsticks while eating. If you prefer Italian cuisine, don’t order pasta as garnish and don’t eat a meal and a coffee with milk together. After a dinner, you may order an espresso only.

Finally, when you finish your dinner, compliment on food and ask for a bill. You can pay cash or by card. It is on your preference. In some restaurants tips are already included in a bill, in others you decide whether to give a gratuity or not.
