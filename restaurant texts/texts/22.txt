You might not be ready to order food right away. First, you may need to ask the server some questions about the food. For the sake of these examples, we’ll talk about fried chicken. Here are some things you might ask the server about fried chicken.

How is the fried chicken made? (You may want to know what seasoning comes on the chicken or what type of oil they fry the food in.)

What side items come with the fried chicken?

Can I substitute one side item for another? (If you don’t like a side item that usually comes with the fried chicken, you can ask to replace, or “substitute” it with something else. For example, you may choose to substitute the potatoes with macaroni and cheese or vegetables. The server could say yes or no, or they might tell you that you can, but it’ll cost a little more.)

What do you recommend?

Which do you like more, the fried chicken or grilled chicken?

Some of these require a simple “yes” or “no” from the server. Others might require you to be familiar with food-related vocabulary to understand their response.

When it’s time for dessert, you may ask these questions:

Do you have a dessert menu?

Can you describe the chocolate cake?

Which dessert is your favorite?
