 I would like to tell about my favourite restaurant which is called Trattoria Formaggi. This Italian cuisine restaurant is located in one of the central streets. It is a very cosy place with a quiet and relaxing atmosphere. In front of the entrance there is a summer terrace where guests can enjoy a light business lunch or a cup of delicious Italian coffee.

The air-conditioned spacious dining room is elegantly decorated in warm tones. Quiet music is played in the background. The waiting staff will be happy to give all the information about new and specialty dishes.

Mainly there are Italian dishes on the menu. Guests can order fresh pizza, delicious pasta as well as excellent meat and fish specialties. A wide range of salads and snacks is also served here. After a lunch or dinner, you will be offered to try one of the wonderful desserts. The meal can be accompanied by alcoholic and non-alcoholic cocktails or other refreshments.
