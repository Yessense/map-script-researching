When you've finished your meal and you're ready to leave, ask your waiter for the bill. In many countries a service charge of 10% to 20% of the total amount is added to the bill. This is meant to be shared among the service staff, but in North America and some Eastern European countries a service charge isn't added. In these places you should give a tipÂ¹ of 15% to 20% directly to the waiter instead. Waiters and other staff like bartenders are usually paid very low wages, so when eating out try to tip generously, especially in countries like the USA where a service charge isn't added to the bill.
