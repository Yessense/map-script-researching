Catch the waiter’s attention and ask “Can we have the bill, please?” or “Check, please.” to see how much you need to pay. The waiter might ask if you want to pay separately or as a group. Check the bill to see if a service charge or tip has been added. This is money that is given to the waiting staff for good service. If this hasn’t been added, it’s common in most English speaking countries to leave some extra money (usually 10-15% of the bill) for the waiter.

So, now you know how to order food at a restaurant in English, all that’s left to do is enjoy your food and have a great time!
