I like to spend time with my family a lot. My parents like to make surprises for us and for each other. So we went to museums, galleries and very often my father organizes the evening in a restaurant for the whole family.

My mom says itâ€™s nice to forget about house work sometime and enjoy one nice dinner with the family.

Last weekend we went to the restaurant not far from my home. It was very nice and warm evening, so we walked there. My dad booked a table for us near the window and we were not in a hurry. We arrived about 19.00 and the restaurant was almost full.

We ordered salad as a starter, steak as a main dish and cheese cake. Sometime we take different dishes and share the opinion.

The music was not loud and slow. Some people went to dance. And we prefer to speak about our goals and plans in future.

We have been to different restaurants. Some of them are in the center of the town and they are more expensive. We like to explore new places.

The service is usually good, the waiters are polite and hospitable.

My mom cooks very well, but we like to try sometime something new and unusual.

I think a dinner in a restaurant is a great possibility to stay with your family relaxed, quiet and enjoy every minute of communication.
