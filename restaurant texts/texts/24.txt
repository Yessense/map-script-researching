Cafes are coffee shops that offer a variety of cakes, coffees, teas, specialty drinks, and sometimes food to their customers. We often go to cafes to visit with friends, take a break from work, read a book quietly  or to pass some time. Most cafes are self-service, meaning that the customers order from the counter and serve themselves.
