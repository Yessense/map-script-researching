Is there a problem with the food or anything else in the restaurant? When reporting a problem, it’s good to use polite phrases.

Excuse me, my food is cold.

Pardon, this isn’t what I ordered.

May I speak to your manager, please?

Here are a couple of phrases you could hear from the server after you report a problem:

I’m sorry!

Would you like to speak to a manager?

I’ll get the manager for you.

Would you like me to get you something else?

When something goes wrong with a customer’s food, many servers send the manager to the table so you can talk to someone in charge. They do this either to make the customer feel comfortable by talking to someone who’s “higher up,” or because the manager actually does have the power to give you a discount in the restaurant’s computer system.
