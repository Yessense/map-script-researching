It’s customary for the server to bring the bill to your table before you even ask for it. However, if the restaurant is busy or your server has forgotten to deliver your bill, you might need to ask for it. Here are a few things you can say:

Excuse me, we’d like the bill.

We’re ready to pay.

Can we have the check, please? (“Check” and “bill” mean the same thing at a restaurant.)

Do I pay you, or do I pay up front?

The server may have some questions, such as:

Can I get you anything else, or are you ready for the check?

Would you like a box? (If you didn’t eat your whole meal, your server may ask you if you’d like a box to take your left-over food home.)

Will you be paying together or separately?

Will that be cash or card?
