What I prefer to do when I want to enjoy myself is go to a cafe with my friend because it's a way to cheer me up and to chat about everything I want to. "Coffee et Chocolate" is a good chain coffee house in Saratov city. Most of all I like to go to one that is located in Kirova street. 

Coffee et Chocolate provides the customers with a rich tea and coffee list, desserts, and ice-creams. You may pop into this cafe to have breakfast, lunch or dinner. The quality of food is out of the world beginning from coffee up to second courses.

The coffee house tries to create a tranquil atmosphere in order to attract customers. The waitresses are smiley and are ready to serve quickly. There is always French music or French songs which you may enjoy listening to.

The last time I ate out there on the 12-th of October with my friend before going to the Drama theatre. It was raining all day long, the rain beat against the windows. We were sitting in cosy armchairs, drinking coffee, eating sweet cakes "Tiramisu", and watching the passers-by through the window. We were satisfied with the service as usual I should say, and I was surprised by the waitress who did not take notes but remembered our order, by the way we ordered a lot. After having a lunch there we went to the theatre.

I would recommend this cafe to anyone who likes cosy atmosphere, where you can plunge and just relax, you may chat with friends there and listen to the French music if you wish.
