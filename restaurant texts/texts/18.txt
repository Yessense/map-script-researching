In Paris, every restaurant has its own hours and only a few restaurants open until midnight. If you want to eat out at a popular restaurant and be sure of getting a table, it is better to book first or get there by 8pm. If you prefer to dine early, you can go to some restaurants that are open during the day and still serve food until 7pm. Many restaurants stop operating their kitchens after 10.30pm, so it is often difficult to find a restaurant open in the middle of the night.
