After delivering your food, your server should check on your table once or twice to see how everything is. Here are some possible phrases you could hear:

How is everything?

Does everything taste good?

How did everything come out?

Here are some possible positive and negative responses:

It’s delicious!

Everything is great, thank you.

Actually, my food is a little cold.

Excuse me, I ordered french fries, but I got potatoes.

The server will likely ask, “Can I get you anything else?” You may ask for another drink, a refill of water, extra dressing or some condiments.
