Having a drink is a great way to pass the time while you are deciding what to order. The waiter might ask “Would you like to start with a drink?” and you can reply “Yes, we’d like (type of drink) while we decide on our food.” If you order a bottle of wine, the waiter might ask “Would you like to taste the wine?” when he opens the bottle for you. If you like it, you can reply “Yes, that’s fine.”
