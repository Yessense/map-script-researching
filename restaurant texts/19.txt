Empty tables do not guarantee you a seat. If the tables are already booked, the waiter will not seat you until the guests arrive and finish their dinner. In Parisian restaurants, customers cannot be rushed and can stay as long as they want. Therefore, asking before seating yourself is the right etiquette. Just walking in and sit at an empty table is not advisable, except at a very informal eatery.
