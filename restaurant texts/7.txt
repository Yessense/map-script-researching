When the waiter asks “Are you ready to order?” or “Can I take your order?” If you are ready, you can give your order. Use “I’d like…” or “I’ll have…” to introduce your order and expression “for starter/appetizer” to talk about the first course and “for main course” to talk about the second course of food you will eat.

If you are not sure what to order, ask the waiter “What would you recommend?” to get some advice or “What are the specialities?” to find out what the most famous dishes are at that restaurant. You could also ask “What are today’s specials?” to find out if there are any dishes being served today that are not usually on the menu.

If you want to order wine with your main course, you can use the waiter’s expert knowledge to help choose something great. Ask the waiter “What wine goes well with this?” or “What wine matches this?” to make sure they taste great together.
