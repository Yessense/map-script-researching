Just as you should wait for your guests to order before you do, you should also wait for them to take the first sips of wine and first bites of their food. "When wine or drinks are first served, always wait for the guest to drink first, then follow," says Geiger. "The same applies to food when it first arrives at the table, wait for the guest's lead. He or she should begin eating first, then the guests should follow."
