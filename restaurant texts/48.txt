Perhaps, when choosing a dish, it will not always be clear to you what it consists of. If you are allergic, be sure to learn the names of the foods to which you are allergic and inform the waiter. Maybe you just don't like a certain ingredient? You can ask the chef to prepare the dish without him. Have you been served hot food at room temperature? Ask to replace or reheat the dish. Or maybe they gave you a dull knife? Ask to replace it.
