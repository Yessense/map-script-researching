In France, bread, cutlery, glasses and serviettes are complimentary. Some restaurants even provide free appetizers for their loyal customers. Of course, a carafe or tap water is also complementary and you can ask for it more than once.
Finally, because a tip is included in the bill, you do not have to leave a tip. Tipping in Paris is about 5-10%. If you prefer not to tip, you can spend your money instead on flowers sold on restaurant terraces and give it to the person you are with.
